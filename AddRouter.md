# Adding Router and ChatScreenRoom Component(https://www.tortilla.academy/Urigo/WhatsApp-Clone-Tutorial/master/next/step/6)

In this chapter we will learn how to build a chat room screen. In order to navigate between different screens, we will setup a router.

Since we're gonna have two screens in our app now - ChatsListScreen and ChatRoomScreen, we will need a router that will be able to alternate between them. We will be using the react-router-dom package to manage the routes of the application:

```sh
yarn add react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
```
